# Glitch Support Tool

Various tools to make supporting Glitch users easier:
* suspend and unsuspend projects
* delete custom domains
* TODO:
  * add / update custom domains
  * query tools (c.f. https://glitch.com/edit/#!/glitch-stats-bot?path=app.js:9:0 and subsequent)
  * make this an api instead of a jquery app
  * add error handling / messaging

For security reasons, you'll need an admin token to actually submit anything, 
 you can use your persistent token from application..persistentToken().
